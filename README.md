# Random-Stuff-I-Made

This is really just a collection of random stuff I made. You most likely wont find much of use here.

## Dice Roller

You input your dice as it states, and it will roll the dice for you. Do keep in mind, this program doesn't have error messages for now. If you mess up the formatting it will give you a Python error and end the program, however I do plan on adding built in error messages in the future.

## Fizz Buzz

This is a simple program which does the age old game of Fizz Buzz. There isn't really any purpose to it, it was just practice.

## Number Sorter

This sorts a selection of 1000 random numbers.

The two varieties are a simple text version and a Tkinter version. The text version simply out puts the numbers it will sort, and the sorted version of them. The Tkinter version on the other hand actively prints the random numbers and sorted versions as it calculates them, meaning, while it looks nice, it takes much longer to actually work. Also, due to the window size, larger amounts of numbers can make them run off screen. It was ultimately a way for me to try out Tkinter.

## Population Simulation

Despite the name, this isn't meant to accurately simulate the growth of population on Earth, rather I couldn't think of a better name and "Population Simulation" had a nice ring to it. Population starts at 100. Every year (Or "Tick") there will be a minor calculation. It will take a birth rate of 0.0186 and a death rate of 0.0078, and after minor randomization, apply that to the population. However, there is a 10 in 100 chance there will be a "Bad Year". During these birth rates are halved and death rates are doubled. If there is no Bad Year, there will be a 10 in 100 chance for there to be a "Good Year", which doubles birth rates and halves death rates. Bad Years can occur back to back, however Good Years can only occur if more than 10 years have passed since the last Good Year. These are to make it more interesting, where the population isn't as stable nor is it as steep of an incline.

# Final Notes

All Python here are written in Python 3, so make sure you have Python 3 and not Python 2 if you want to try them.

In addition to that, many of the programs (Excluding the Dice Roller) require modification to the code to change their numbers. I will most likely add user input later to counter this.

Also, don't expect the code to be in any way optimal, I am still very new to coding.

Finally, I am not quite sure what I will do with this repository. This is just a place for me to store and share the random programs I make from time to time to practice my Python, so don't expect overly common commits.

Other than that, thank you for checking out the repository.
